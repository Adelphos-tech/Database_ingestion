## 📊 ROI Calculator

### Calculate Your Costs

```
Daily Captchas = (Pages/day × Captcha Rate)
Monthly Cost = (Daily Captchas × 30 × Price/1000)

Example:
- 1,000 pages/day
- 20% captcha rate
- Using 2Captcha ($2.99/1K)

Daily Captchas = 1,000 × 0.20 = 200
Monthly Cost = 200 × 30 × $2.99/1000 = $17.94
```

| Service | Monthly Pages | Captcha Rate | Break-Even Cost |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Any** | 1,000 | 10% | $0.90-$3 |
